# Jayson's Python Toolbox

## Jayson Stemmler (<jstemm@uw.edu>)

This toolbox package is a collection of classes, functions, utilities, and plots
that I have developed over the course of doing my research. It is not intended
to be a distributed package, but you are free to fork/clone and install if you
wish to do so.

This comes with the usual disclaimer that some things (or all things) may not work
properly. I am doing my best to make sure that they do work properly, and in most
cases things work for my usage scenarios.

## Overview

This section is intended to provide a brief overview of the different sections
and features of the package. For more in-depth and detailed analysis I would 
refer you to the README pages in the individual module folders.
